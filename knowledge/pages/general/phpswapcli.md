# Command Line Usage

This package includes a simple CLI tool that lets you swap PHP for a single terminal window.

## Installation

Adjust your `$PATH` to be able to locate _phpswap/cli/bin_.

`export PATH=/Users/aklump/Code/Php/phpswap/cli/bin:$PATH`

## Usage

1. Type `phpswap` in your terminal window to see the available PHP versions.
2. Choose a PHP version and copy that command that is printed.
3. Paste that command into the same window to swap to that version.

The swap only affects the current terminal window. Simply close the window when you're done.
